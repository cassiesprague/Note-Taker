# Note Taker
![License: Apache](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

## Description
This application allows users to create and save notes they make and can be used for many different purposes. 

My motivation for this application was to have a way to keep note of the things I need to get done. I can also use it as a grocery list, for reminders for upcoming events, birthdays, and many others.
